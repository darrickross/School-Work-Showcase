# Prompt / Overview
Write a program in the language of your choice which calculates values in of a
rocket launch.

- `T` Time in *seconds*
  - Starting at 0.1 seconds
- `S` Distance in *meters*.
- `V` Velocity in *meters per seconds*
  - When velocity goes negative the program stops.
- `A` Acceleration in *meters per second ^2^*
- `F` Net Force from engine in *Newton*
- `M` Mass of the rocket in *grams*


This can be used to plot the basic stats of a rocket launching until it reaches
its peak of the launch arch. Right before it falls back to earth.
