## Problems
Some assignments utilized outside environments like [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to run this code and test functions output. At the time of writing I do not have access to these notebooks and do not have the code needed to properly test the original assignment code I wrote.

I also chose not to make any changes to the code since I wrote it in 2018. The only thing I have done is reorganize the directory structures and wrote this `README.md`.
